#Currently Task objects take a command+arguments.
#Classes defined here allow greater flexibility in the specification of what a Task should run
#Particularly where
# 1. One command launches another command
# 2. Pre/post execution commands are required
# 3. The chain of commands to execute can be modified pre and post Task instantiation
# 4. Environment variables correspond to different parts of the chain e.g. LSF envs v MPIrun envs v Job envs
# 5. Control resolution of bash command subs

#This requires that Task object has the ability to be take a richer object than a string for specifying what to do.

# That is a Task executes a Command/ExecutorChain and possibly an ExecutionStack
# Internally a Task can modify the passed Command/ExecutorChain and create an ExecutionStack


#Environments and Variable Expansion
#
#Composition of environments and resolution of environment variables can get complicated.
#
#At the moment the rules are simplified - both to see how far that takes us and because configuration file
#format only gives certain granularity.
#
#1. The environment of all components in a chain is the same (GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT)
#2. This environment is composed of all the individual environments
#3. Composition rules: ??
#4. Expansion variables is done on the host by the Task instance running the chain
#5. The expansion assumes the environment is CLOSED i.e. it is evaluated w.r.t to itself only.
#(Is this actually true ...)
#
# Note: This does not mean that expansion does not take place elsewhere e.g. when configuration file is read.
# It only applies to environment as they were set when creating Command/Executor instances.

            This is only used when resolving a command line argumente
        basePath: Path used to resolve relative executables. If None the workingDir is used.

                the resulting string to `echo`
            'none': do not bash expand at all

        Note: Some executables behave differently if run via a link versus the linked executable.
        An example are ImageMagick tools like "montage" and "convert" which are links to "magick"
        The available command line options for "montage" are not valid for "magick" as "magick"
        detects it is being run via the "montage" link and applies different criteria to the command line in this case.

class Executor(Command):

    '''A program which executes another program - the target.

    The target can be another command/executor.

    Environment and Targets:

    There are two possibilities for composing the environments of target and executor.
    1. GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT: The environment returned by an instance is the sum of the executor and target environments
        Both the executor and the target will see the same environment
    2. PARTITIONED ENVIRONMENTS: The environment returned by an instance is the executor environment.
        The target environment is set by the executor via command line options

    In the first case the responsibility for expanding environment variables is pushed up the stack.
    Usually it will be the Task instance executing the Executor chain that decides what to do.

    In the second case the executor will be responsible for expanding the variables of its target.
    There are three options
           - Resolve w.r.t. target environment only on the calling process host. (The environment set is closed)
           - Resolve w.r.t the calling process environment
           - Wait for run-time resolution

    Critically the last case is dependent on having a shell and furthermore the visibility of the envars
    on the command line (escaping)
        - No escaping. Envar expansion depends on the executing process of the full chain being a shell
        - Escaped. Envar expansion depends on this executors parent providing a shell.

    In either case if there is no shell there will be no expansion.

    Summary:

    Four resolution schemes

    Global
    Partitioned-Static
    Partitioned-Runtime-Global
    Partitioned-Runtime-Local

    We will only support Global at the moment as the others require the ability to partition environments
    in the configuration file.
    For example we set MPI environment for dl_meso which has to contain both dl_meso and mpi related envars
    which can't be separated.
